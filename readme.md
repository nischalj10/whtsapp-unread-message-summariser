project is a wip!

### unread whatsapp group messages summariser

sick of going through 100s of messages in whatsapp groups? but also do not want to miss out on cool stuff that's happening? i think this exptension would be super helpful!

### Building the extension locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Do `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Do `npm run dev`. This will spin up a dev server with vite. 
4. A `dist` folder will be generated. Open Chrome, and go to chrome://extensions/
5. Enable Developer Mode (option in top-right corner of the screen) if not already enabled
6. Click on "Load Unpacked" extension button. Select the generated `dist` directory. The extension will be up and running locally.
